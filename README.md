# SafePusher

Run your favorite linters and specs on the files you touched, before committing and pushing your branch.

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
# Lint and launch specs before pushing.
gem 'safe_pusher', require: false
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install safe_pusher

To use the gem fully, you should install [pronto](https://github.com/prontolabs/pronto) and [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) first.

## Configuration

Generate the `binstubs` for `pronto`, `rspec` and `safepush`:

    $ bundler binstubs pronto rspec-core safe_pusher

Create the `safe_pusher.yml` file at the root of your application:

```yaml
files_to_skip:
  - file/to/skip_1
  - file/to/skip/2
base_branch: developement # default master
app_base_directory: app
repo_url: https://github.com/williampollet/safe_pusher
services:
  test: rspec
  lint: pronto
  push: github
  open: github
  add: git
  amend: git
  commit: git
verbose: true
```

## Usage
To see the commands available, type:

    $ safepush

To run pronto checks before you push to GitHub run:

    $ safepush lint push open

or

    $ safepush l p o

To run specs and pronto before you push to GitHub run:

    $ safepush test lint push open

or

    $ safepush t l p o

### Available commands so far
 - `test` (runs the tests only on the files you touched)
 - `lint` (runs a linter only on the files you touched)
 - `commit` (commit your changes)
 - `add` (track your changes)

## Contributing

You can easily add a new client, or a new command. 

### To add a client 
 - create the client api under `lib/safe_pusher/client/***.rb`
 - require it in `lib/safe_pusher.rb`
 - write the specs for your client, then submit a PR
 - You will be able to specify in which command to use it, via the configuration ! 

### To add a command
 - configure your command and its client in `config/commands.yml`
 - create your safepusher client api, as detailed above (if necessary)
 - include your command's description in the help, in `config/en.yml`

# SafePusher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/williampollet/safe_pusher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/williampollet/safe_pusher)

Run your favorite linters and specs on the files you touched, before pushing your branch.

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
# Lint and spec before pushing
gem 'safe_pusher', require: false
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install safe_pusher

To use the gem fully, you should install [pronto](https://github.com/prontolabs/pronto) and [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) first.

## Configuration

Generate the `binstubs` for `pronto`, `rspec` and `safepush`:

    $ bundler binstubs pronto rspec-core safe_pusher

Create the `safe_pusher.yml` file at the root of your application:

```yaml
files_to_skip:
  - file/to/skip_1
  - file/to/skip/2
app_base_directory: app
repo_url: https://github.com/williampollet/safe_pusher
```

## Usage

To see the commands available, type:

    $ safepush

To run pronto checks before you push to GitHub run:

    $ safepush ppush

To run specs and pronto before you push to GitHub run:

    $ safepush ppushtest
